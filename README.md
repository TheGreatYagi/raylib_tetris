# TETRIS!


This is a hand-built clone of tetris in C using Raylib.


## Build instructions


1. First download raylib and build it according to your platform:

```
$git clone https://github.com/raysan5/raylib.git

# Follow instructions here:
https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/tree/master#build-and-installation
```

2.  Once built, configure your path to point to build directory (typically found in /path/to/dowloaded/raylib/raylib)
```
export RAYLIB_PATH=/path/to/dowloaded/raylib/raylib
```
3. Finally run make in raylib_pong directory to build game. Currently the make file is optimized for Apple Silicon. Will eventually update to include Windows and Linux
